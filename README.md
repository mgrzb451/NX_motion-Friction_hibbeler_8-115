# Siemens NX - Motion Simulation - Friction
I tried simulating this problem from Hibbeler's Static textbook, unfortunately wasn't able to fully solve it - not sure how to calculate the force P through Contact interaction.
I did however learn about the formula for maximum moment on a planar collar bearing 💪

# 2D Verification
As per usual Mr. Hibbeler's mechanisms require a bit of validation and tweaking before being considered valid 😅

# 3D Model
I learned how to create a Position Motor with varying rates of speed, acceleration and deceleration. Animation Designer is great but just like many parts of NX very unintuitive at times 🤔

# Partial Result
I learned about basic simulation of gears and I was able to extract a correct value for the torque transmitted between the gears
